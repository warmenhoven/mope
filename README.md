mope is an mp3/ogg player.
This is really tailored specifically to my needs.
It plays both mp3s and oggs (thanks to [mpg321](http://mpg321.sf.net/) and ogg123 (part of [vorbis-tools](http://www.vorbis.com/download_unix.psp))), and pipes them to [ices2](http://www.icecast.org/ices.php) via stdin.
It has a way of letting an external program (even on remote computers) control playback.
